# Diabetes Insights: Building Predictive Models to Predict Diabetes Status

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e774aa4-2c9f-4e89-9eb4-29bfaf91fa0c)


## Introduction
Diabetes is a growing global health issue characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, leading to serious complications if unmanaged. Early prediction is essential for effective intervention and prevention. This project focuses on developing predictive models to determine an individual's diabetes status using health-related data. By applying machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression to the dataset diabetes-dataset.csv, the goal is to identify key risk factors and create accurate tools that can help healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals for timely treatment.

## Features
### Feature 1: gender
This is a categorical variable with three responses: 'Female,' 'Male,' and 'Other.' It represents the gender of each observation in the dataset.

### Feature 2: age
This is a numerical variable indicating the age of each observation in the dataset.

### Feature 3: hypertension
This is a numerical variable with two possible values: 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the observation does not have hypertension, while a value of 1 indicates that the observation has hypertension.

### Feature 4: heart_disease
This is a numerical variable with two possible values: 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the observation does not have heart disease, while a value of 1 indicates that the observation has heart disease.

### Feature 5: smoking_history
This is a categorial variable with six responses: "No Info," "never," "former," "current," "not current," "ever." It represents the smoking history of each observation in the dataset.

### Feature 6: bmi
This is a numerical variable indicating the Body Mass Index (BMI) of each observation in the dataset.

### Feature 7: HbA1c_level
This is a numerical variable indicating the Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of each observation in the dataset.

### Feature 8: blood_glucose_level
This is a numerical variable indicating the blood glucose level of each observation in the dataset.

### Response variable: diabetes
This is a numerical variable with two possible values: 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the observation does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the observation has diabetes.
